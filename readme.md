# NOTE: This is a work in progress.

This is my current configuration setup for Klippet running on a BIQU B1 with an IDEX kit and a Bigtreetech SKR2 controller board. It is working well but since it is still a work in progress, tuning and adjustmens may be needed.
 I am currently using Cura as the slicer and the start and end G-Code to copy paste in there can be found (here)[]
