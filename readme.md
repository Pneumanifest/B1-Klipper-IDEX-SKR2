This is my current configuration setup for Klipper running on a BIQU B1 with an IDEX kit and a Bigtreetech SKR2 controller board. It is working well but since it is still a work in progress, tuning and adjustmens may be needed.
 I am currently using Cura as the slicer and the start and end G-Code to copy paste in there can be found [here](Slicer_Start_and_end_Gcode.md).
 
 # The main parts to import are the printer.cfg and the machine folder with its contents. They are setup to work together. The [btt-skr-2.cfg](/machine/btt-skr-2.cfg) file is where most of the adjusting is done.
